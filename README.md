# pychip8
A simple CHIP-8 emulator created in Python 3 and Pygame. 
This is a very early WIP. _It is non-functional at the moment_.

## Setup
To run the project please make sure you have Python 3 installed. Make sure to enable the _configure PATH_ option if installing on Windows. Open the directory you have downloaded or git cloned the project into in a terminal and run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will can then run the project with:
```
python pychip8
```

If you wish to modify the code, remember you can run all the unit tests with:
```
python -m pychip8.tests
```
